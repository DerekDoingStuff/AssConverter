# AssConverter
.ass script to plain text

I ran into an issue where I wanted to get the subtitles stripped out of an .ass subtitle file in order to read them easily on a computer without all of the noise that comes with the file.

I made this quick program to facilitate that.

Oh and I find the name funny.
